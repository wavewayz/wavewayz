Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I hope this message finds you well. I noticed that you have a GitHub account, and I was wondering if you might be able to help me out with something.

I'm planning to work on some coding projects, but my current username 'NotWaveWayz' is not very user-friendly and could cause confusion. Since you're not currently active on GitHub, I was wondering if you might consider changing your username to something else, so that I could use it instead.

I understand that changing your username is a big ask, and if it's not possible or feasible for you to do so, I completely understand. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know.

It can be changed here: https://github.com/settings/admin

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this message. I really appreciate your consideration.

Best regards.
